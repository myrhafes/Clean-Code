# **Introduction**

 - Book is about software engineering craftsmanship.
 - There is two aspects of craftsmanship.
	 - knowledge: principles, patterns, practices and heuristics.
	 - Application (of knowledge): using the knowledge every day when reading lot of code, making mistakes, arguing over it, seeing the price you pay for wrong decisions.
	 
 - Three parts of the book:
	 - Part 1: principles patterns and best practices of writing clean code.
	 - Part 2: case studies and exercise to use knowledge gathered in part 1.
	 - Part 3: summary list of heuristics to detect semmly (bad) code learnt from part 2.

	 

> Warning !
> Just knowing principles is not enough, you will have to use them daily, as an engineer you will have to write and review lots of code and get yours code reviewed by senior people and learn from your mistakes.


> Important:
> The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/min.
